# Issue Resolution: Blank Page on GitHub Pages

## Problem Statement
The page appears blank when visiting the deployed GitHub Pages site at:
https://ronnymn.github.io/standalone-charts-cart/

## Investigation Summary

### What Was Checked
1. ✅ Repository structure and file organization
2. ✅ Build configuration (`vite.config.ts`, `package.json`)
3. ✅ Source code (`App.tsx`, `main.tsx`, `index.html`)
4. ✅ GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
5. ✅ Local development build (works correctly)
6. ✅ Production build preview (works correctly)
7. ✅ GitHub Actions workflow execution logs

### Root Cause Identified
**GitHub Pages is not enabled in the repository settings.**

The GitHub Actions workflow "Deploy to GitHub Pages" fails at the deployment step with:
```
Error: Failed to create deployment (status: 404)
Ensure GitHub Pages has been enabled: https://github.com/ronnymn/standalone-charts-cart/settings/pages
```

### Why This Happens
- The workflow successfully builds the project
- It creates the deployment artifact correctly
- However, when it tries to deploy to GitHub Pages, the API returns 404
- This indicates that GitHub Pages is not enabled for the repository
- Without GitHub Pages enabled, there's no deployment target, so the site remains blank/inaccessible

## Solution

### Required Action (Repository Admin)
1. Navigate to repository settings: https://github.com/ronnymn/standalone-charts-cart/settings/pages
2. Under "Build and deployment" section:
   - Set **Source** to **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Save the settings
4. Either push a new commit to `main` or manually re-run the workflow

### What Happens After Enabling
- GitHub Pages will be activated for the repository
- The next workflow run will successfully deploy to GitHub Pages
- The site will be accessible at: https://ronnymn.github.io/standalone-charts-cart/
- Users will see the Highcharts License Calculator interface (not a blank page)

## Expected Result

Once GitHub Pages is enabled and the workflow runs successfully, visitors will see:

- **Title**: "Highcharts License"
- **Subtitle**: "Select the products you need. Bundles are applied automatically."
- **Four product cards**: Core ($185), Stock ($370), Maps ($250), Gantt ($222)
- **Interactive functionality**: Clicking products updates the total with automatic bundle discounts
- **Total display**: Shows the calculated price based on selected products

## Verification Steps

After enabling GitHub Pages:

1. **Check Workflow Status**
   - Go to: https://github.com/ronnymn/standalone-charts-cart/actions
   - Verify that the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow completes successfully
   - Both "build" and "deploy" jobs should show green checkmarks

2. **Visit the Site**
   - Navigate to: https://ronnymn.github.io/standalone-charts-cart/
   - Page should load without being blank
   - All product cards should be visible

3. **Test Functionality**
   - Click on "Core" - total should show $185
   - Click on "Maps" - total should show $65 (add-on pricing)
   - Other products should show discounted add-on prices when Core is included

## Technical Details

### Build Configuration
- **Build tool**: Vite 7.3.1
- **Framework**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Base path**: `/standalone-charts-cart/` (correctly configured)
- **Output directory**: `dist/`

### Deployment Workflow
- **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch or manual dispatch
- **Build step**: `npm ci && npm run build`
- **Artifact**: Contents of `dist/` folder
- **Deployment target**: GitHub Pages (requires Pages to be enabled)

### Why the Code is Correct
- Local development server works perfectly
- Production build compiles without errors
- Preview of production build shows correct functionality
- All asset paths are correctly configured for GitHub Pages
- The `.nojekyll` file is properly created to bypass Jekyll processing

## Conclusion

**No code changes are required.** The application is built correctly and works as expected. The blank page issue is entirely due to GitHub Pages not being enabled in the repository settings. Once enabled by a repository administrator, the site will deploy and function correctly.
